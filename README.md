Stack algorithm
=================

A stack is an array with limited functionality.
You can only:
* push - add a new element to the top of the stack,
* pop - remove top element, and
* peek - select top element without popping it off.

## Why important?

In many algorithms you want to add objects to a temporary list at some point and then pull them off this list again at a later time. Often the order in which you add and remove these objects matters.

A stack gives you a LIFO or last-in first-out order. The element you pushed last is the first one to come off with the next pop.
